Use case of road traffic prediction around the port of Piraeus has been developed. The first part includes the entire part of data processing and manipulation as well as exploratory analysis. In this, by means of different graphs such as heat maps or line graphs, an attempt is made to understand some of the underlying patterns or seasonality in the data, such as work migrations. In the second and third part, the prediction part is developed with the use of the Prophet time series algorithm, from an approach with only the base information to the inclusion of additional attributes such as time and port activity such, as arrival-related data of passenger ships.
